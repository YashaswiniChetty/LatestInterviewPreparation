Why? reduce dependency so that engineers can change one area of code without impacting others.
  1) Single Responsibility Principle : One class should have one and only one responsibility.Means we should write change and maintain a class
  for one and only one purpose. Testing will be easier Ex service layer, repository layer class

  2) Open Closed Principle: A class or a component should be open for extension but closed for modifications
      Open for extension means we can extend and inlcude extra functionality without affecting existing impl
      Closed for modifications: After adding extra functionality , we should not modify existing functionality
      Ex: Here Employee class is open for extension and closed for modification

   3) Liskov Substitution Principle : Derived types must be completely substitutable for theri base types

Liskov Substitution Principle:
Interface Segregation Principle:
Dependency Inversion:
