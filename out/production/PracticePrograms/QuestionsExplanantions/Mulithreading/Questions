   Process Based                              Thread Based
   Heavy Weight                               Light Weight
   Requires own separate address space        Shares the same address space
   Interprocess communication is expensive    Inter thread communication is inexpensive
   Context switching is also costly           Context switching is also not costly

2) What is Thread : Thread is a light weight process within Process. java create Thread by using Thread class or Runnable interface
   All java programs have atleast one thread called main thread, which get created by JVM  when main method gets invoked

3) Types of Threads : User Thread and Daemon Thread
   User Thread : All the threads created by developer inside the main thread are called user threads and non Daemon
   Daemon Thread : Low priority thread that runs in background to perform tasks such as GC etc.
   JVM terminates itself when user threads complete their task , it does not care where daemon thread is running or not .
   If JVM finds running daemon thread upon completion of user threads , it termicates and shutdonw itself
