If a class has atleast one abstract method, then class should be declared as abstract
If a class is abstract we cannot create object of that class
A class can be declared as abstract even if no abstract methods present
If the method is declared as abstract complusory subclass should provide impl else subclass should also be declared as abstract
we can create a constructor of abstract class
