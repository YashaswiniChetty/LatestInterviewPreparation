 /*STACK:methos,local variables,reference variables,
 It grows and shrinks as new methods are called and returned respectively
 Variables inside stack exist only as long as the method that created them is running
 It�s automatically allocated and deallocated when method finishes execution
 If this memory is full, Java throws java.lang.StackOverFlowError
 Access to this memory is fast when compared to heap memory
 This memory is threadsafe as each thread operates in its own stack
 
 HEAP:Heap space in Java is used for dynamic memory allocation for Java objects
 If heap space is full, Java throws java.lang.OutOfMemoryError
 Access to this memory is relatively slower than stack memory
 This memory, in contrast to stack, isn�t automatically deallocated. It needs Garbage Collector to free up unused objects so as to keep the efficiency of the memory usage
 Unlike stack, a heap isn�t threadsafe and needs to be guarded by properly synchronizing the code
